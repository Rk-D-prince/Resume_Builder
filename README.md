How the Problem Was Approached and Solved
Understanding the Task:

The goal was to create a tool that converts a LinkedIn PDF resume into an HTML format. 
The steps involved were: extracting text from the PDF, generating an HTML resume using the OpenAI API, and allowing users to view and download the result.
Setting Up the Environment:

Installed necessary libraries:
Streamlit: For creating a web-based user interface.
PyPDF2: For reading and extracting text from PDF files.
OpenAI: For generating HTML content based on the extracted text.
Extracting Text from PDF:

Created a function to open the PDF and read its content:
PyPDF2 was used to handle PDF files.
The function iterated over each page of the PDF, extracted text, and combined it into a single string.
Generating HTML Resume:

Used OpenAIâ€™s API to create an HTML version of the resume:
Formulated a prompt asking the API to convert the extracted text into a professional HTML resume.
The API responded with the generated HTML content, which was then extracted from the response.
Building the Streamlit App:

Developed the user interface using Streamlit:
Included input fields for the OpenAI API key and PDF file uploader.
Processed the uploaded PDF and generated the HTML resume using the previously defined functions.
Displayed the HTML resume and provided a download button for users to save the resume.
Testing:

Tested the application with different PDF resumes to ensure text extraction and HTML generation worked correctly.
Verified that the HTML resume displayed properly and could be downloaded as expected.
